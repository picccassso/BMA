🖥️ What is **BMA**?

BMA turns your personal music library into a private streaming service — powered by your own devices. Whether you're on a PC, Mac, Linux machine, or a Raspberry Pi, BMA lets you stream music to your Android phone securely using Tailscale, without exposing anything to the public internet.
There’s no cloud, no port forwarding, and no privacy trade-offs — just instant, encrypted access to your music wherever you are.

🛠️ **How It Works**

- The desktop app (Go + Fyne) lets you select a local folder as your music library.
- The server runs locally and streams your music over HTTP via Tailscale’s secure mesh VPN.
- Your Android device connects by scanning a QR code, pairing instantly with the server.
- Metadata is retrieved, albums are organized, and the music starts flowing — just like a private Spotify.
- A CLI version is available for Raspberry Pi, ideal for low-power streaming setups. Supports setup via browser and runs headlessly.

🔐 **Note: Music currently streams over HTTP within Tailscale’s encrypted tunnel. Native HTTPS support is planned.**
